    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pho got its start in northern Vietnam around the beginning of the twentieth century.
        The exact circumstances are unclear, but Vietnam’s signature noodle soup resulted from cultures rubbing
        shoulders. There are many theories about the original pho but one good explanation points to a glut of beef
        parts – bones, offal, and tough cuts leftover from French colonialists slaughtering cows for their tender
        steaks. Locals were enjoying a water buffalo-based rice vermicelli noodle soup.</p>

    <p>Street vendors began tweaking their water buffalo soup by using beef and changing the rice noodles from round
        ones to the flat ones you see today. Such old-school pho with delicate broth, rice noodles, and thin slices of
        cooked beef is wonderful but over time, vendors and diners dolled things up with lots of add-ins (herbs,
        condiments, vegetables!). Cue slices of raw beef. And when beef wasn’t available, people made pho with chicken.
        From there, cooks got creative and now there are pho banh mi, cocktails, dumplings, cookbooks, and more!</p>
